## Mini-API

Mini-API is built as the API layer for the Bitcoin Mini project and servers as that part of the Mini Computing stack that can be used by plugins or third party apps that want to run on the Mini. It fits in between the Operating System and the Graphical User Interface to provide access to a system API and a bitcoin API. Optimized for use with mini-ui.
